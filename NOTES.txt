/* TODO:

Speed up decoding by skipping intervalFor 
- check "last time through the look bug"

4. conserve memory with a DNAString type (?)
5. add some more unit tests

- gccgo was much slower than go
- using bufio was somewhat slower than not
- Scanner vs. ReadBytes made little difference: Scanner may be slightly faster

1. encoding / decoding with 16-bit version => 11 million correct reads, and an error at a string of Ts
2. enocoding with 16 bit version, decoding with 32-bit version produces the exact same problem
3. encoding / decoding with the 16-bit version using the first 11 million reads gives the same problem for the last few reads (**)
4. encoding with 32 bit field gives exactly same result as encoding with 16 bit field

5. VERSION 12a1da4 works for both encoding and decoding. This is the new baseline
